# Traffic Sign Classifier

A simple LeNet based classifier used to classify [German Traffic Signs Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

The model for training the dataset involves some adaptations from the research paper titled [Traffic Sign Recognition with Multi-Scale Convolutional Networks](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf) by Pierre Sermanet and Yann LeCun.
